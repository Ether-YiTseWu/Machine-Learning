## Project01 : Regression
- Goal :       
(1) According to the data of pokemon, try to predict the cp value after pokemon evolution.      
(2) According to the sensor data, try to predict the PM2.5 by today information.

## Project02 : Logistic Regression
- Goal :       
Use logistic regression to deal with two class data.
